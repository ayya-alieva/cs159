Hard Parameter sharing:
-----------------------
This does multitask learning on all seven environments simultaneously
(may need to change pythonw to python)

pythonw hard_param.py --env HighGravityInvertedPendulum-v0  LowGravityInvertedPendulum-v0 InvertedPendulum-v2 LongInvertedPendulum-v0 LowFrictionInvertedPendulum-v0 HighFrictionInvertedPendulum-v0


Soft Parameter sharing:
-----------------------
Soft parameter sharing is done on pairs of two environments. The second environment is passed as an argument, and the first is fixed to always be inverted_pendulum. Tests need to be run on each of the seven environments


pythonw a2c_softparam_try2.py --envs HighGravityInvertedPendulum-v0

The high gravity environment should be replaced by each of the other 
environments (do not pass InvertedPendulum-v2)

Fine Tuning sharing:
-----------------------
Fine tuning is done on pairs of two environments. The second environment is passed as an argument, and the first is fixed to always be inverted_pendulum. Tests need to be run on each of the environments

pythonw fine_tuning.py --envs HighGravityInvertedPendulum-v0

The high gravity environment should be replaced by each of the other 
environments (do not pass InvertedPendulum-v2)
